## Description

This project is to build an application encouraging the users to stay active, enjoy the fresh air and sunshine found on the top of the mountain. Skiing is an excellent way to burn a ton of calories while getting in some great runs and feeling healthier. The application will be created as  a MERN stack single-page application in which the users will be able to browse through the different ski packages and add the package or remove the package before checkout.  Stripe payment platform will be used for the users to pay for the package.

The URL of the GitHub repository is https://github.com/stellalph/MERN-Ski-Resort.git and the repository name is MERN-Ski-Resort.

The URL of the deployed application is https://still-harbor-63486.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies

* The application is a MERN stack application which is a group of four technologies that is :-

    * REACT (for the front end)
    * GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server
    * MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database

*   The MERN stack has a three-layer architecture based on Model-View-Controller pattern and each interconnected layer performs a specific function in the application:-

  | Client (View)          | React JS                   | User inputs data and Data display                        |
  | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Server(Controller)** | **Express.js and Node.js** | **Method called to store and retrieve data in database** |
  | **Database(Model)**    | **MongoDB**                | **Stores raw data and contains no logic**                |
